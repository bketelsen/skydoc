Abstract

   SkyDNS is a distributed service for announcement and discovery of
   services.  It leverages Raft for high-availability and consensus, and
   utilizes DNS queries to discover available services.

1.  SkyDNS

   SkyDNS (Announcement Blog Post [1]) is a distributed service for
   announcement and discovery of services.  It leverages Raft ([Raft])
   for high-availability and consensus, and utilizes DNS queries to
   discover available services.  This is done by leveraging SRV records
   in DNS, with special meaning given to subdomains, priorities and
   weights.

   SkyDNS will also act as a forwarding DNS proxy, so that you can set
   your SkyDNS instance as the primary DNS service in "/etc/resolv.conf"
   and SkyDNS will forward and proxy requests for which it is not
   authoritative.

   Besides serving SRV records, which include _all_ the information you
   need to connect to your service, SkyDNS will also return A records.
   This is useful if you already know what port a particular service is
   using, and you just want a list of IP addresses with known running
   instances.

   The development of SkyDNS takes place on Github ([SkyDNS-git]).

2.  Services

   SkyDNS divides the name for a service in different components, as
   follows:

   Name:  The name of your service, e.g., "rails" or "web".  Note that
      in this document we sometimes refer to this as Service.

   Environment:  Denotes the environment of the service, e.g.
      "production" or "testing".

   Region:  Where do these hosts live, e.g. "east", "west" or even
      "test".

   Version:  A version string, e.g. "1.0.1".

   Host:  The hostname of a machine running the service.

   A service name will use these components in a fixed order:

   <Host>.<Version>.<Region>.<Name>.<Environment>

   Service names are registred by a submitting an HTTP query (with JSON
   data) to SkyDNS, see Section 3 for more details.  Querying SkyDNS can
   be done either via HTTP or via the DNS (see Section 4)
