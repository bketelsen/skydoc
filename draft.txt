1.  SkyDNS

   SkyDNS (Announcement Blog Post [1]) is a distributed service for
   announcement and discovery of services.  It leverages Raft ([Raft])
   for high-availability and consensus, and utilizes DNS queries to
   discover available services.  This is done by using SRV records in
   DNS, with special meaning given to subdomains, priorities and
   weights.

   SkyDNS will also act as a forwarding DNS proxy, so that you can set
   your SkyDNS instance as the primary DNS service in "/etc/resolv.conf"
   and SkyDNS will forward and proxy requests for which it is not
   authoritative.

   Besides serving SRV records, which include _all_ the information you
   need to connect to your service, SkyDNS will also return A records.
   This is useful if you already know what port a particular service is
   using, and you just want a list of IP addresses with known running
   instances.

   The development of SkyDNS takes place on Github ([SkyDNS-git]).
   SkyDNS is written in the Go language ([Golang]).  It is licenced
   under the MIT License, see []#(License).

2.  Services

2.1.  Naming

   Service names are registered by a submitting an HTTP query (with JSON
   data) to SkyDNS, see Section 3 for more details.  Querying SkyDNS can
   be done either via HTTP or via the DNS (see Section 4).  SkyDNS
   divides the name for a service in different components, as follows:

   Name:  The name of your service, e.g., "rails" or "web".  Note that
      in this document we sometimes refer to this as Service.

   Environment:  Denotes the environment of the service, e.g.
      "production" or "testing".

   Region:  Where do these hosts live, e.g. "east", "west" or even
      "test".

   Version:  A version string, e.g. "1.0.1".

   Host:  The hostname of a machine running the service.

   A service name will use these components in a fixed order:

   "Host" "Version" "Region" "Name" "Environment"

   Each registered service has a time to live (TTL).  When the TTL
   expires the services is expunged from SkyDNS.

3.  Service Management

   SkyDNS exposes a RESTful (TODO: REF) interface.  There are two entry
   points:

   1.  "/skydns/services/UUID", used for service management.

   2.  "/skydns/callbacks/UUID", used for callback management.

   The UUID (TODO: REF) is generated _by the client_ and used the
   identifer for the service.  Each request MUST carry a JSON [RFC4627]
   payload with is defined in the sections below.

   SkyDNS also supports a shared secret which is used for
   authoritzation.

3.1.  Registration

   Whe registring a service a client generates an UUID (denoted $UUID
   here) and makes a HTTP PUT request to `/skydns/services/$UUID` with
   the following JSON payload:

   {
     "Name":"TestService",
     "Environment":"Production",
     "Region":"Test",
     "Version":"1.0.0",
     "Host":"web1.example.com",
     "Port":9000,
     "TTL":10
   }

     Figure 1: JSON payload definition when registring a service with
                                  SkyDNS.

   Note: the are new elements here:

   Port:  Specifies the port where the service runs.

   TTL:  Specifies the time to live (TTL) for this services in seconds.
      When the TTL expires the services is removed from SkyDNS.

   If a service with this $UUID already exists you will receive back an
   HTTP status code of: *409 Conflict*

   When using HTTP authorization and the wrong password SkyDNS will
   return an HTTP status code of: *403 Forbidden*

   If successful SkyDNS will return an HTTP status code of: *201
   Created* SkyDNS will now have an entry for your service that will
   live for the number of seconds supplied in your TTL (10 seconds in
   our example), unless you send a heartbeat to update the TTL.

   Note that instead of a hostname you can also use an IP address (IPv4
   or IPV6), in that case SkyDNS will make up an hostname:
   "$UUID.skydns.local".

3.2.  Heartbeat

   SkyDNS requires that services submit an HTTP request to update their
   TTL within the TTL they last supplied.  If a service fails to do so
   within this timeframe SkyDNS will expire the service automatically.
   This will allow for nodes to fail and DNS to reflect this quickly
   (also see Section 3.4).

Internet-Draft                   SkyDNS                     January 2014


   The TTL can be updated by sending an HTTP PATCH request to SkyDNS ("/
   skydns/services/$UUID") with an updated TTL: "{ "TTL":20 }".

   TODO(miek): patch other things too.

3.3.  Deregistration

   To remove a service from SkyDNS without waiting for the TTL to
   expire, you simply send an HTTP DELETE, without any JSON data to "/
   skydns/services/$UUID".

3.4.  Call backs

   Registering a call back is similar to registering a service, the URL
   for registering call backs is "/skydns/services/$CUUID", where
   "$CUUID" is the UUID the client generates for this call back.  A
   service that registers a call back will receive an HTTP request,
   every time something changes in the service definition the callback
   is executed.  Currently they are called when the service is deleted.

   {
     "Name":"TestService"
     "Environment":"Production"
     "Region":"Test"
     "Version":"1.0.0"
     "Host":"web1.example.com"
     "Reply":"web2.example.com",
     "Port":5441
   }

     Figure 2: JSON payload definition when registring a callback with
                                  SkyDNS.

   First the service for which this callback is added is named.  Then
   the call back return address is specified:

   Reply:  Reply back to this address.

   Port:  Reply back to this port.

   Thus in this case it will result in the call back being sent to
   "web2.example.com" on port 5441.  The callback itself will be a HTTP
   DELETE, with the name of the service as the JSON payload:

   {

     "Environment":"Production"
     "Region":"Test"
     "Version":"1.0.0"
     "Host":"web1.example.com"
   }

   TODO(miek): failed callback registration, deleting callbacks (not
   supported).

4.  Service Discovery

4.1.  DNS

4.2.  HTTP

   TODO

5.  Implementation

   The current implementation of SkyDNS ([SkyDNS-git], consists out of
   server and a client library.  This client library is used in a
   command line tool "skydnsctl" which allows for easy registration and
   querying of SkyDNS.

5.1.  DNS Forwarding

   By specifying nameserver on the "skydns" command line, you create a
   DNS forwarding proxy.  Requests for which SkyDNS isn't authoritative
   will be forwarded and proxied back to the client.  This means that
   you can set SkyDNS as the primary DNS server and use it for both
   service discovery and normal DNS operations.

   When provided with more than one nameserver SkyDNS will round robin
   between the them to spread the load.

   _Please test this before relying on it in production, as there may be
   edge cases that don't work as planned._

6.  Security Considerationso

   Security depends very much on the randomness of the generated UUIDs

A.1.  Examples

   Let's take a look at some results.  First we need to add a few
   services so we have services to query against.

// Service 1001 (East Region)
curl -X PUT -L http://localhost:8080/skydns/services/1001 -d '{"Name":"TestService","Version":"1.0.0","Environment":"Production","Region":"East","Host":"web1.site.com","Port":80,"TTL":4000}'

// Service 1002 (East Region)
curl -X PUT -L http://localhost:8080/skydns/services/1002 -d '{"Name":"TestService","Version":"1.0.0","Environment":"Production","Region":"East","Host":"web2.site.com","Port":8080,"TTL":4000}'

// Service 1003 (West Region)
curl -X PUT -L http://localhost:8080/skydns/services/1003 -d '{"Name":"TestService","Version":"1.0.0","Environment":"Production","Region":"West","Host":"web3.site.com","Port":80,"TTL":4000}'

// Service 1004 (West Region)
curl -X PUT -L http://localhost:8080/skydns/services/1004 -d '{"Name":"TestService","Version":"1.0.0","Environment":"Production","Region":"West","Host":"web4.site.com","Port":80,"TTL":4000}'

   Now we can try some of our example DNS lookups: #####All services in
   the Production Environment "dig @localhost production.skydns.local
   SRV"

A.1.3.  All TestService Instances at any version, within the East region

   "dig @localhost east.*.testservice.production.skydns.local SRV"

   This is where we've changed things up a bit, notice we used the "*"
   wildcard for version so we get any version, and because we've
   supplied an explicit region that we're looking for we get that as the
   highest DNS priority, with the weight being distributed evenly, then
   all of our West instances still show up for fail-over, but with a
   higher Priority.

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;east.*.testservice.production.skydns.local. IN SRV

;; ANSWER SECTION:
east.*.testservice.production.skydns.local. 531  IN SRV 10 50 80   web1.site.com.
east.*.testservice.production.skydns.local. 3881 IN SRV 10 50 8080 web2.site.com.

east.*.testservice.production.skydns.local. 3887 IN SRV 20 33 80   web3.site.com.
east.*.testservice.production.skydns.local. 3892 IN SRV 20 33 80   web4.site.com.

A.1.4.  A Records

   To return A records, simply run a normal DNS query for a service
   matching the above patterns.

   Let's add some web servers to SkyDNS:

curl -X PUT -L http://localhost:8080/skydns/services/1011 -d '{"Name":"rails","Version":"1.0.0","Environment":"Production","Region":"East","Host":"127.0.0.10","Port":80,"TTL":400000}'
curl -X PUT -L http://localhost:8080/skydns/services/1012 -d '{"Name":"rails","Version":"1.0.0","Environment":"Production","Region":"East","Host":"127.0.0.11","Port":80,"TTL":400000}'
curl -X PUT -L http://localhost:8080/skydns/services/1013 -d '{"Name":"rails","Version":"1.0.0","Environment":"Production","Region":"West","Host":"127.0.0.12","Port":80,"TTL":400000}'
curl -X PUT -L http://localhost:8080/skydns/services/1014 -d '{"Name":"rails","Version":"1.0.0","Environment":"Production","Region":"West","Host":"127.0.0.13","Port":80,"TTL":400000}'

   Now do a normal DNS query: "dig rails.production.skydns.local"

   ;; QUESTION SECTION:
   ;rails.production.skydns.local. IN  A

   ;; ANSWER SECTION:
   rails.production.skydns.local. 399918 IN A  127.0.0.10
   rails.production.skydns.local. 399918 IN A  127.0.0.11
   rails.production.skydns.local. 399918 IN A  127.0.0.12
   rails.production.skydns.local. 399919 IN A  127.0.0.13

   Now you have a list of all known IP Addresses registered running the
   "rails" service name.  Because we're returning A records and not SRV
   records, there are no ports listed, so this is only useful when
   you're querying for services running on ports known to you in
   advance.  Notice, we didn't specify version or region, but we could
   have.
