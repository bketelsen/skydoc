1.  Technical Notes

   Technical Notes provide documentation and background information
   concerning Skynet and SkyDNS.

2.  SkyDNS

   SkyDNS (Announcement Blog Post [1]) is a distributed service for
   announcement and discovery of services.  It leverages Raft [Raft] for
   high-availability and consensus, and utilizes DNS queries [RFC1034]
   [RFC1035] to discover available services.  This is done by using SRV




Ketelsen, et al.                                                [Page 1]

   records in DNS, with special meaning given to subdomains, priorities
   and weights.

   SkyDNS will also act as a forwarding DNS proxy, so that you can set
   your SkyDNS instance as the primary DNS service in "/etc/resolv.conf"
   and SkyDNS will forward and proxy requests for which it is not
   authoritative.

   Besides serving SRV records, which include _all_ the information you
   need to connect to your service, SkyDNS will also return A or AAAA
   records.  This is useful if you already know what port a particular
   service is using, and you just want a list of IP addresses with known
   running instances.

   The development of SkyDNS takes place on Github [SkyDNS-git].  SkyDNS
   is written in the Go language [Golang].  It is licenced under the MIT
   License, see Appendix B.

3.  Services

3.1.  Naming

   Service names are registered by a submitting an HTTP query (with JSON
   [RFC4627] data) to SkyDNS, see Section 4 for more details.  Querying
   SkyDNS can be done either via HTTP or via the DNS (see Section 5).
   SkyDNS divides the name for a service in different components, as
   follows:

   Name:  The name of your service, e.g., "rails" or "web".  Note that
      in this document we sometimes refer to this as Service.

   Environment:  Denotes the environment of the service, e.g.
      "production" or "testing".

   Region:  Where do these hosts live, e.g. "east", "west" or even
      "test".

   Version:  A version string, e.g. "1.0.1".  Note that any dots in this
      string are converted to hyphens: "-".

   Host:  The hostname of a machine running the service.

   A service name will use these components in a fixed order:

   "Host" "Version" "Region" "Name" "Environment"

             Figure 1: A fully qualified SkyDNS service name.




Ketelsen, et al.                                                [Page 2]

Technical Note 0x1               SkyDNS                     January 2014


   Each registered service has a time to live (TTL).  When the TTL
   expires the services is expunged from SkyDNS.

4.  Service Management

   SkyDNS exposes a RESTful [REST] interface.  There are two entry
   points:

   1.  "/skydns/services/$UUID", used for service management.

   2.  "/skydns/callbacks/$UUID", used for callback management.

   The UUID [RFC4122] is generated _by the client_ and used as an unique
   identifier for the service.  Each request MUST carry a JSON [RFC4627]
   payload with is defined in the sections below.

   SkyDNS also supports a shared secret which is used for authorization.

4.1.  Registration

   When registering a service a client generates an UUID (denoted $UUID
   here) and makes a HTTP PUT request to `/skydns/services/$UUID` with
   the following JSON payload:

   {
     "Name":"TestService",
     "Environment":"Production",
     "Region":"Test",
     "Version":"1.0.0",
     "Host":"web1.example.com",
     "Port":9000,
     "TTL":10
   }

     Figure 2: JSON payload definition when registring a service with
                                  SkyDNS.

   Note: the are new elements here:

   Port:  Specifies the port where the service runs.

   TTL:  Specifies the time to live (TTL) for this services in seconds.
      When the TTL expires the services is removed from SkyDNS.

   If a service with this $UUID already exists you will receive back an
   HTTP status code of: *409 Conflict*





Ketelsen, et al.                                                [Page 3]

Technical Note 0x1               SkyDNS                     January 2014


   When using HTTP authorization and the wrong password SkyDNS will
   return an HTTP status code of: *403 Forbidden*

   If successful SkyDNS will return an HTTP status code of: *201
   Created* SkyDNS will now have an entry for your service that will
   live for the number of seconds supplied in your TTL (10 seconds in
   our example), unless you send a heartbeat to update the TTL.

   Note that instead of a hostname you can also use an IP address (IPv4
   or IPV6), in that case SkyDNS will make up an hostname:
   "$UUID.skydns.local".

   TODO(miek): Not specifying all the elements, sane defaults?

4.2.  Heartbeat

   SkyDNS requires that services submit an HTTP request to update their
   TTL within the TTL they last supplied.  If a service fails to do so
   within this time frame SkyDNS will expire the service automatically.
   This will allow for nodes to fail and DNS to reflect this quickly
   (also see Section 4.4).

   The TTL can be updated by sending an HTTP PATCH request to SkyDNS ("/
   skydns/services/$UUID") with an updated TTL: "{ "TTL":20 }".

   TODO(miek): patch other things too?

4.3.  Deregistration

   To remove a service from SkyDNS without waiting for the TTL to
   expire, you simply send an HTTP DELETE, without any JSON data to "/
   skydns/services/$UUID".

4.4.  Call backs

   Registering a call back is similar to registering a service, the URL
   for registering call backs is "/skydns/services/$CUUID", where
   "$CUUID" is the UUID the client generates for this call back.  A
   service that registers a call back will receive an HTTP request,
   every time something changes in the service definition the callback
   is executed.  Currently they are called when the service is deleted.










Ketelsen, et al.                                                [Page 4]

Technical Note 0x1               SkyDNS                     January 2014


   {
     "Name":"TestService"
     "Environment":"Production"
     "Region":"Test"
     "Version":"1.0.0"
     "Host":"web1.example.com"
     "Reply":"web2.example.com",
     "Port":5441
   }

     Figure 3: JSON payload definition when registring a callback with
                                  SkyDNS.

   First the service for which this callback is added is named.  Then
   the call back return address is specified:

   Reply:  Reply back to this address.

   Port:  Reply back to this port.

   Thus in this case it will result in the call back being sent to
   "web2.example.com" on port 5441.  The callback itself will be a HTTP
   DELETE, with the name of the service as the JSON payload:

   {
     "Name":"TestService"
     "Environment":"Production"
     "Region":"Test"
     "Version":"1.0.0"
     "Host":"web1.example.com"
   }

   TODO(miek): failed callback registration, deleting callbacks (not
   supported).

5.  DNS Service Discovery

   SkyDNS exports the services via HTTP and DNS.  When using the DNS for
   service discovery even unchanged clients can be used.  Queries to
   SkyDNS can contain wildcards or leave parts of the service name out.
   Recall the elements of a service name from Figure 1.  The domain
   syntax when querying follows a pattern where the right most positions
   are more generic, than the subdomains to their left.  This allows for
   you to supply only the positions you care about:

Technical Note 0x1               SkyDNS                     January 2014


          +------------+---------------------------------------+
          | Elements   | Result                                |
          +------------+---------------------------------------+
          | H V R N E  | A specific host                       |
          | V R N E    | All hosts, disregarding the hostname  |
          | R N E      | All hosts in this region              |
          | N E        | All hosts in this environment/name    |
          | E          | All hosts in this environment         |
          +------------+---------------------------------------+

    Table 1: Making requests less and less specific.  In this table the
      following abbreviations are used: H is Host, V is Version, R is
                Region, N is Name and E is for Environment.

5.1.  Wildcards

   In addition to leaving elements out, it is something convenient to
   leave out names "in the middle".  This is supported in SkyDNS by
   means of wildcards.  The wildcard character is "*" (without the
   quotes).  The wildcard can be places anywhere in a service name,
   making that element match anything.  Note the following two service
   names are equivalent.

   Host Version Region Name Environment
     *  Version Region Name Environment

   TODO(miek): more examples.

5.2.  Record Types

   You can query SkyDNS for IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses and server
   records, A, AAAA and SRV records respectively.

   Services can be found by querying SkyDNS via any DNS client or
   utility or via the standard DNS resolution of the underlaying
   operating system.

6.  HTTP Service Discovery

   Currently you may only retrieve a service's info by UUID of the
   service, in the future we may implement querying of the services
   similar to the DNS interface.

7.  Implementation

   The current implementation of SkyDNS ([SkyDNS-git], consists out of
   server and a client library.  This client library is also used in a




Ketelsen, et al.                                                [Page 6]

Technical Note 0x1               SkyDNS                     January 2014


   command line tool "skydnsctl" which allows for easy registration and
   querying of SkyDNS.

7.1.  DNS Forwarding

   By specifying nameservers on the "skydns" command line, you create a
   DNS forwarding proxy.  Requests for which SkyDNS isn't authoritative
   for will be forwarded and proxied back to the client.  This means
   that you can set SkyDNS as the primary DNS server and use it for both
   service discovery and normal DNS operations.

   When provided with more than one nameserver SkyDNS will round robin
   between the them to spread the load.

      Please test this before relying on it in production, as there may
      be edge cases that don't work as planned.

8.  Examples

   Below we will add and query for services in SkyDNS.  It is assumed
   SkyDNS is running on port 8080 on localhost for HTTP and on port 1053
   for DNS.  For "skydnsctl" we use an environment variable:

   export SKYDNS=http://localhost:8080
   export SKYDNS_DNSPORT=1053

   The following services will be added:

    +---------------------+----------+---------+-------+--------------+
    | Host                | Version  | Region  | Name  | Environment  |
    +---------------------+----------+---------+-------+--------------+
    | web1.example.com.   | 1.0.0    | east    | web   | production   |
    | web2.example.com.   | 1.0.0    | west    | web   | production   |
    | web3.example.com.   | 1.0.1    | east    | web   | testing      |
    +---------------------+----------+---------+-------+--------------+

   All running on port 8008 and initially with a TTL of 100 seconds.  We
   used the open source tool "uuidgen" for the generation of the UUID.

     "Version":"1.0.0", "Host":"web1.example.com","Port":8008,
     "TTL":100}'

     "TTL":100}'
   cc5aeaa5-02a5-4d44-91d8-cec4f950af2e

   With "skydnsctl -json" we can list all services (in JSON format) that
   are now registered in SkyDNS.

9.  Security Considerations

   Security depends very much on the randomness of the generated UUIDs

   TODO(miek)

10.  Projects Using SkyDNS

   Skydock:  Skydoc [SkyDock-git] works with Docker [Docker] containers.
      Skydock monitors docker events when containers start, stop, die,
      get killed, etc and inserts records into SkyDNS.  This allows
      standard DNS queries to discover services running inside (other)
      docker containers.

Appendix A.  Examples

   In this document we used the "skydnsctl" command line utility to
   query SkyDNS, but as SkyDNS is using of the shelve protcols (HTTP and
   DNS) you can basically use whatever tool you like.  Even the standard
   resolving library in libc will suffice.

   For instance, registering a service with "curl":

   curl -X PUT -L http://localhost:8080/skydns/services/1001 \
   -d '{"Name":"TestService", "Version":"1.0.0",
        "Environment":"Production", "Region":"East",
        "Host":"web1.site.com","Port":80,"TTL":4000}'

   And then looking up services with "dig".

   All service in the production environment:

   dig +noall +answer @localhost production.skydns.local SRV



Ketelsen, et al.                                                [Page 9]

Technical Note 0x1               SkyDNS                     January 2014


   Which will result in (note the TTL has counted down to 3979 second):

   production.skydns.local.  3979 IN SRV 10 20 80 web1.site.com.

   TODO from here:

   All TestService v1.0.0 Instances in Production Environment "dig
   @localhost 1-0-0.testservice.production.skydns.local SRV"

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;1-0-0.testservice.production.skydns.local. IN  SRV

;; ANSWER SECTION:

1-0-0.testservice.production.skydns.local. 3961 IN  SRV 10 20 80   web4.site.com.

   All TestService Instances at any version, within the East region "dig
   +noall +answer @localhost east.*.testservice.production.skydns.local
   SRV"

   This is where we've changed things up a bit, notice we used the "*"
   wildcard for version so we get any version, and because we've
   supplied an explicit region that we're looking for we get that as the
   highest DNS priority, with the weight being distributed evenly, then
   all of our West instances still show up for fail-over, but with a
   higher Priority.

east.*.testservice.production.skydns.local. 531  IN SRV 10 50 80   web1.site.com.
east.*.testservice.production.skydns.local. 3881 IN SRV 10 50 8080 web2.site.com.
east.*.testservice.production.skydns.local. 3531 IN SRV 20 33 9000 server24.
east.*.testservice.production.skydns.local. 3887 IN SRV 20 33 80   web3.site.com.
east.*.testservice.production.skydns.local. 3892 IN SRV 20 33 80   web4.site.com.

   A Records To return A records, simply run a normal DNS query for a
   service matching the above patterns.

   Let's add some web servers to SkyDNS:

curl -X PUT -L http://localhost:8080/skydns/services/1011 -d '{"Name":"rails","Version":"1.0.0","Environment":"Production","Region":"East","Host":"127.0.0.10","Port":80,"TTL":400000}'
curl -X PUT -L http://localhost:8080/skydns/services/1012 -d '{"Name":"rails","Version":"1.0.0","Environment":"Production","Region":"East","Host":"127.0.0.11","Port":80,"TTL":400000}'
curl -X PUT -L http://localhost:8080/skydns/services/1013 -d '{"Name":"rails","Version":"1.0.0","Environment":"Production","Region":"West","Host":"127.0.0.12","Port":80,"TTL":400000}'
curl -X PUT -L http://localhost:8080/skydns/services/1014 -d '{"Name":"rails","Version":"1.0.0","Environment":"Production","Region":"West","Host":"127.0.0.13","Port":80,"TTL":400000}'

   Now do a normal DNS query: "dig +noall +answer
   rails.production.skydns.local"

   Now you have a list of all known IP Addresses registered running the
   "rails" service name.  Because we're returning A records and not SRV
   records, there are no ports listed, so this is only useful when
   you're querying for services running on ports known to you in
   advance.  Notice, we didn't specify version or region, but we could
   have.
